# MyFirstNueralNetwork
A nueral network built from scratch used to recoginse with an image has a horse or a human. It is a logistic Regression nueral network which is trained through the tensorflow datasets trainning pictures.

# Main Libraries used:
Numpy -- for all the mathematical and statistic element of the project.

Scipy -- for additional mathematical functions

Tensorflow database -- used the tensorflow API to get a large amount of good labeled data to train and test the API

Tkinter -- GUI to test more images

# Current progress:
The nueral network its self is done and working, working at an accruacy rate of 90% for the test data.
Now using tkinter to form a simple GUI to allow the nueral newtork to be interactive and allow for self testing.
